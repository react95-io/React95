# Contributing

Any help from UI/UX designers would be EXTREMELY appreciated. The challenge is
to come up with new component designs/layouts that are broadly used in modern
UIs, that weren't present back in 95.

If you want to help with the project, feel free to [open pull requests][1],
[submit issues or component proposals][2] and join our [Slack channels][3]!
Let's bring this UI back to life ♥️
